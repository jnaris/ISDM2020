# Information System Development Methodologies - Assignment 1 Report
Authors: Leen Khawaja, Jasmin Narisetty, Yash Parge, Michael Zenkis

## 1. Objectives, Problem Definition
Problem Definition:

The travel company has both inbound and outbound calls for their holiday packages. The call flow rate is bottlenecked due to the variety in holiday packages that the travel company offers. This is because, relationship managers may be connected to customers that would like to know about a package or location that the relationship manager may not have the appropriate knowledge for. This causes potential customers to be less likely to purchase a package.

Objectives:
* Match customers to relationship managers that are more suitable for them
* Develop information system that will allow relationship managers to more effectively meet the needs of customers
* Improve call routing and dynamic call flow for both inbound and outbound calls
* Improve customer retention and sales of travel packages  


## 2. Stakeholders
* Travel Company (client)
* Relationship Managers
* Customers
  * New customers
  * Existing/recurring customers

## 3. Design Thinking Approach
Design thinking is a customer centered systematic approach to convert need’s into demand via what is technologically feasible and viable from a business strategy point of view. It is a design philosophy that puts customers and stakeholders at the center of the process, ensuring that the end result has been carefully curated to address stakeholder needs. It comprises of 5 main processes: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. Our group went through this process chronologically to try and better understand craft a solution to the case given to us.
### Empathize:
Empathizing refers to obtaining a deeper understanding of a stakeholder’s points of view in order to ensure the solution meets their needs. This can be done by asking open-ended questions which probe deep into their experiences in their environment. Some of these questions include:
* What would the user be thinking and feelings?
* What does the user say about the product?
* What gains/pains might the user experience while using the product?

Our group utilized empathy maps in order to build this understanding of our stakeholders. Each individual was assigned an empathy map to build, and all empathy maps were then reviewed by the team to ensure that they were done to their maximum potential. This allowed us to progress to the next stage, the define stage.
### Define:
The define stage refers to utilizing the information gained from the empathize stage in order to help find the needs of the stakeholders and develop their point of views. This was done via a point of view statements (POV) for each of the stakeholders identified. POV statements identify the stakeholder, their need and the insight developed by identifying the stakeholder and their needs. E.g. A relationship manager needs to be matched to appropriate customers through the profiler tool because it will make them more convincing to targeted customers and increase the possibility for customer retention. 
This insight is a fundamental part of the design thinking process as it helps define the problems that needs to be solved. We were each assigned a stakeholder to construct a point of view statement for, in order to derive an understanding of the problems faced by each stakeholder. Once these problems were identified we were ready to move onto the third stage of the process, the ideation stage.
### Ideate:
In the ideation stage we build on the insights gained from the define stage and convert them into potential solutions. For this step, we used the POV statements and the insights gained from those statements and converted them into How Might We (HMW) statements. HMW statements convert the POV statements into problems that can be solved. E.g. How might we provide relationship managers with customers that are more likely to be influenced by their sales skills and knowledge.
For each of these HMW statements, our team began brainstorming ideas for potential ways to solve these problems. As we did not want to restrict ourselves, we brainstormed any potential idea that we had, without worrying about feasibility. Once we had a large selection of ideas that we could choose from, we began the voting on the ideas that we believed were most feasible based on the 3 design thinking criteria: 
* Most likely to succeed
* Most likely to delight
* Most likely to breakthrough

Once the best ideas were identified via the votes, we were able to begin working on the next stage, the prototype stage.
### Prototype & Testing:
Prototyping allows us to create a rough outline of the project and fleshes out any questions that may have been raised and any assumptions that need to be made. These assumptions might not have been thought of during the ideation stage, thus making the prototype stage a vital component of the design thinking process. For this stage of the process, we began by using backlog to create use cases for some user stories. We then used the created use cases make activity diagrams. Although all diagrams had a single person responsible for them, they were all done with extensive consultation with the other group members during group calls. This is how we were able to test the prototype. E.g. It was discovered during the consultation that the class diagram was missing a few relationships which had to be added. This allowed us to iteratively add and improve each of the diagrams we made.


## 4. Agile Methology Approach

### Introduction to Agile:
The main difficulty with software development projects is risk. Over 60% of all software development projects that fail can be attributed to: 
* Incomplete, general and not testable requirements 
* Unrealistic time schedule agreement 
* Inadequate testing
* Inundation of features in releases of the product
* Overall lack of communication

The above points are addressed with the agile methodology approach to software development. Agile involves ensuring a high level of communication between stakeholders as well as the team members within the project. Agile recognises that plans change very often, new ideas can be brought up after the immediate meeting with the stakeholders and that a project must be flexible in order to succeed with the changing nature of technology. The mthodology also revolves around iteration of stages for every short release. This means, thorough testing and a reasonable amount of features are decided upon to ensure it can be completed within the short iterative schedule which is employed by agile. The main outcome of agile is incremental delivery of working software that is iteratively improved upon and updated as the implementation process continues. 

The agile manifesto lists 4 comparitve terms that define the agile methodology. Two of these were directly used throughout the project as the other two fell outside the scope of this project. 
* Customer satisfaction over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.

Both of the above were followed during the planning and designing of this project. The customer, namely the Travel Company stakeholders were continually in contact and providing updated information regarding requirements. At no point was the contract negotiated or changed. Due to these changing requirements, the team had to continually respond and adapt to ensure the product design fulfilled all of the requirements. 

### Scrum
Agile has many different methodologies that fall underneath the overarching procedures of agile, one of which is Scrum. Scrum was decided upon by the team to be used due to the project bried exclusively stating the changing nature of requirements of the project. This brief also mentions close contact with the stakeholders which will be delivering these updated and modified requirements throughout. Scrum allowed the team to effectively adjust and expect changes to occur throguhout the development of the project, and through the scrum processes within agile, the team was able to efficiently complete the planning and designing stages of the project to be implemented at a later stage. 

Following the scrum processes, the team worked effectively at self organising and ensuring that the work was completed according to the schedule of the various scrum members. The team adjusted meeting times according to various events and committments team members had throughout the project, aligning with the flexibility attribute of scrum. 

Scrum is broke up into 3 main roles: 
* Product owner 
* Scrum master 
* Development team

Due to the scope of the project there was no explicitly define PO however we did have a Scrum master, Jas, who also was part of the development team due to the overarching situation. The development team involved all members of the group and this can be demonstrated by the active changes and updates that were made to the repository throguhout the project planning and design. 

Throughout the project, various team members were self allocating and discussing the various sections of work to be completed. Communication between team members was conducted through online Zoom meetings, which according to scrum and overarching agile, is most certainly not preferable. Due to the current situation the team members were in, we did not have the ability to meet face to face which would have been a more effective communication method. The team was able to adapt to the changing nature of work and focus on high productivity characterised by scrum.

The high level of cooperation between team members was facilitated through the GitHub repository that was initiated at the beginning of the project. This repository was used in order to allow changes to be reviewed and discussed by the different members. Any concerns and changes were raised in the pull request thread, these changes were then made and the updates were added to the master repository branch. Many online tools such as lucidchart were also used which allowed live collaboration and immediate feedback from other team members in the development of the UML diagrams. 

The backlog which was created towards the beginning of the project outlines the user stories which are to be addressed during the implementation phase which falls outside of the scope of this project. However, due to the nature of this project, there were no official sprints used for implementation purposes. The team however did exercise sprints in creating the various different documentation and UML diagrams which were required within the scope of the project. The team did participate in scrum meetings whenever there was work being conducted on the project. This involved each team member discussing their current progress on their task, outlining any problems they're facing as well as what they hope to achieve before the next meeting. These stand up scrum meetings only lasted for less than 10 minutes however gave all team members a clear idea of what others were working on as well as offer to help with any difficulties after the scrum meeting was over. 

The team worked effectively and employed many of the scrum processes and we aligned with the agile methodology in order 
to effectively deliver the planning and designing stage of the project. 

## 5. Assumptions
The team had discussions surrounding the scope of the system. We took into consideration the design of the solution that we would have to complete (such as Use cases, and class diagrams) as well as the specification and needs of the client. We wanted the solution to focus on **analysis** of data stored in the Profiler Tool, as well as the **process** of an RM receiving and conducting a sales call (before and during a call). We thought that data should come from a customer/RM database, the Profiler Tool should conduct the analysis of each customer/RM record, and the proposed system would match the customer and RM, based on their profile. So, the processes carried out within the proposed system must include the Profiler Tool and customer DB. 
Additionally, the team discussed whether or not actually handling calls (i.e., receiving a call from a customer or conducting a call) would be in scope. We thought this could be useful, however as the specification stated, a Call Management Centre (a different information system), would be handling this. This was helpful to us, as we could design the solution's focus to be on patterns analysis and providing suggestions to RMs to help improve customer service, rather than enabling the operations of the business. In sum, the solution is not business critical, meaning that the Travel Company does not require the system to receive and take calls. It is simply an additional service which helps **improve** RM accuracy, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.

* The Profiler Tool will have the records of both Customers and RMs. This will be connected to the solution.
* All customer data (including repeat customer data) comes from the profiler tool. Therefore the customer score (1-10) is provided to the system via the profiler tool.
* The Target List will always match a Relationship Manager with their Specialised Package (the package that they are most familiar with, included in their Profile).
* In scope. The system will...
  * match the customer and RM (based on their profile).
  * create a target list for each RM (list of customers that the RM needs to contact).
  * generate a script for the RM to use in their call to the customer. The scripts will be pre-written and administered according to how well a customer’s profile suits the script. 
  * calculate the RM skill-score using data from the Profiler Tool and previous call history (stored on the system).
  * match customers to RMs based on skill-score and customer score.
* Out of scope. The system will not;
  * handle any data entry or storage during or after the sales process. For example, handle customer payment details or travel reservations.
  * store customer or RM *profiles*. It may retrieve the profiles from elsewhere (Profiler Tool) for analysis.
  * reroute or redirect inbound/outbound calls. This will be handled by the Call Management System.

## 7. Competitive Advantages
Within the digital age, it is imperative that all industries and businesses take advantage of rapidly developing technologies to encourage change, improve existing processes, and potentially increase sales. Due to the advent of automation and networked technologies, manual labour has become expensive, inefficient, and time-consuming. Not only this, but storage and analysis of data becomes more difficult if a business is not able to implement technology solutions to accommodate the large volume of information which they are accumulating.

In the case of the Travel Company, the proposed solution aims to analyse customer and employee data, uncover otherwise unknown patterns, and make suggestions based on these patterns. These suggestions - such as customer/RM matching and generated sales scripts - can be utilised for the benefit of both the employee and customer, and this can lead to potential competitive advantages for the company. Should the design and implementation of the solution be successful and meet the quality of work expected by the client, the travel company may experience a **large increase in their capacity to receive and conduct customer calls, both inbound and outbound**. This increase means that RMs are spending more time conducting sales calls, potentially closing sales of travel packages, leading to an increase in sales and profit. Not only this, but the company gains a major competitive advantage due to the fact that they are implementing networked technologies that will enable analysis of data, matching RMs to customers based on preexisting data. Other companies in the market may not have thought of utilising existing stakeholder data in a way that improves customer satisfaction. As a result, **calls are more effective as time is not wasted offering products which customers are not interested in**, instead, an RM can utilise the proposed solution to quickly identify which products should be offered to the customer. This, in turn, **reduces the time taken to close a sale, providing more time for an RM to take additional sales calls**. Also, since the RM and customer are matched based on personality, and demographics, it is more likely that **a customer will develop a positive relationship with the RM based on common ground, encouraging repeat sales and recurring customers**. The generated script will also **streamline the RM’s work, and enable them to build and strengthen relationships with customers** as there is little guess-work involved in understanding a customer’s needs. Therefore, the successful implementation of the proposed information system will give the Travel Company a competitive advantage in relation to relationship marketing; by conducting more sales calls that are relevant and tailored to the individual customer, creating positive relationships and experiences to encourage repeat sales.

## 8. Effects of Project Failure
However, there are also some potential effects to the Travel Company should the project fail. Firstly, there are many reasons for project failure; not enough funds for resources, going over-budget, time constraints, complications regarding the client specification, executive decisions, and de-prioritisation due to the project being out of the scope of business critical activities. No matter how the project fails, there are always some adverse effects which can potentially leave a client financially damaged. For example, the Travel Company may not be able to handle the influx of calls which they are receiving at any given time, leading to **long waiting queues**. If a customer is not matched with an RM who understands their needs, **customers might become frustrated or angry with the RM’s inability to provide relevant products**, or the two parties may face **personality clashes** which can leave the customer feeling unsatisfied. This could result in poor customer experience and tarnished reputation via word-of-mouth marketing, triggering a loss of sales. Moreover, the RMs will not have the guidance and structure of a target list and generated scripts. This may lead to **inefficient sales calls** whereby the RM is not suited to discuss a certain product, and they might appear incompetent or unknowledgeable.
