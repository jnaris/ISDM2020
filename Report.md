## 5. Assumptions
* The Profiler Tool will have the records of both Customers and RMs. This will be connected to the solution.
* All customer data (including repeat customer data) comes from the profiler tool. Therefore the customer score (1-10) is provided to the system via the profiler tool.
* The Target List will always match a Relationship Manager with their Specialised Package (the package that they are most familiar with, included in their Profile).
* The system will...
  * match the customer and RM (based on their profile)
  * create target list for each RM: list of customers that the RM needs to contact
  * generate a script for the RM to use in their call to the customer. The scripts will be pre-written and administered according to how well a customerâ€™s profile suits the script. 
  * calculate the skill-score using data from the profiler tool and previous call history from the system
  * direct calls from customers to RMs based on skill-score and customer score
* The system will not;
  * handle any data entry or storage during or after the sales process. For example, handle customer payment details or travel reservations.
